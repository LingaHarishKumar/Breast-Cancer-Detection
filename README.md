# Breast-Cancer-Detection

In this project we have explored and build a ml model for breast cancer dataset.

In this problem we will be classifying whether the person is diagnosis with malignant / benign.

The libraries which i have used are : Numpy | Pandas | Seaborn / Matplotlib | Sklearn

For this , i have used classification ml algorithm :

1) DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER
2) RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER
3) LOGISTIC REGRESSION
4) KNEIGHBOUR CLASSIFIER

I have used Grid Search to see which is the best parameter for a pmodel.
