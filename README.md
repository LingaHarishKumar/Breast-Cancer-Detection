# Breast-Cancer-Detection

I perform some ML algorithm on Breast Cancer dataset

The problem is to classify whether the person has diabetics / not ( 0 / 1 )

For this problem, i used some classification ml algorithm like 
1) Support Vector Classifier
2) Decision Tree Classifier
3) Logistic Regression


I have used Grid Search to see which is the best parameter / model.
